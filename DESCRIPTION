Description: mist (Methylation Inference for Single-cell along Trajectory) is a hierarchical 
 Bayesian framework for modeling DNA methylation trajectories and performing differential methylation 
 (DM) analysis in single-cell DNA methylation (scDNAm) data. It estimates developmental-stage-specific 
 variations, identifies genomic features with drastic changes along pseudotime, and, for two 
 phenotypic groups, detects features with distinct temporal methylation patterns. mist uses Gibbs 
 sampling to estimate parameters for temporal changes and stage-specific variations.
